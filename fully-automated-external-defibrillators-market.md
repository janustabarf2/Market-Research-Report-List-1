<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fully Automated External Defibrillators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase Wave</li><li>Biphase Wave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Fully Automated External Defibrillator (AED) market is primarily segmented into single phase wave and biphasic wave devices. Single phase wave AEDs deliver a continuous electrical shock in one direction, which can be less efficient for certain heart rhythms. Conversely, biphasic wave AEDs provide shocks in two phases, reversing the direction of the current, which enhances defibrillation efficacy and reduces myocardial injury. This technological advancement has made biphasic devices more prevalent in modern emergency medical settings.</p></p>
